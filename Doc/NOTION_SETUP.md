# Notion API Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you connect your portfolio to a Notion database to dynamically manage your projects.

## Prerequisites

- A Notion account
- A Notion database with your projects

## Step 1: Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click "New integration"
3. Fill in the basic information:
   - Name: Your Portfolio Integration
   - Logo: (optional)
   - Associated workspace: Select your workspace
4. Click "Submit"
5. Copy the "Internal Integration Token" - you'll need this for your `.env` file

## Step 2: Set Up Your Notion Database

Create a new database in Notion with the following properties:

### Required Properties:
- **Title** (Title) - The project title
- **Description** (Text) - Short project description
- **Category** (Select) - Project category with options:
  - embedded
  - mechatronics
  - interactive
  - automation
  - iot
  - other
- **Technologies** (Multi-select) - Tech stack used
- **Date** (Date) - Project completion date
- **Status** (Select) - Publication status with options:
  - Published
  - Draft
  - Archived

### Optional Properties:
- **Image URL** (Files & media) - Project thumbnail image

**Note:** Detailed project content (full description, challenges, results) should be added as page content in Notion, not as properties. The integration will automatically fetch and display the full page content.

## Step 3: Share Database with Integration

1. Open your projects database in Notion
2. Click the three dots (â€¢â€¢â€¢) in the top right
3. Click "Add connections"
4. Search for and select your integration
5. Click "Confirm"

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the database URL from your browser
2. Extract the database ID (the string between the last `/` and the `?` in the URL)
3. Update your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_NOTION_TOKEN=your_integration_token_here
VITE_NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id_here
```

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Projects page
3. Look for the connection status indicator:
   - ðŸŸ¢ "Connected to Notion" - Integration working
   - ðŸŸ¡ "Using fallback data" - Integration not configured or failed
4. Use the refresh button to manually sync data

## Database Schema Example

Here's how to structure your Notion database:

| Title | Description | Category | Technologies | Date | Status | Image URL |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|------|--------|-----------|
| Smart Home System | IoT automation project | iot | ESP32, MQTT, Node.js | 2023-06-15 | Published | [uploaded image] |

### Page Content Structure

Instead of using properties for detailed content, structure your Notion page content like this:

```
# Project Overview
Detailed description of what the project does and its purpose...

## Technical Implementation
How the project was built, architecture decisions...

## Challenges & Solutions
Problems encountered and how they were solved...

## Results & Impact
Outcomes, metrics, achievements...

## Future Improvements
Plans for enhancement or lessons learned...
```

The integration will automatically convert this content into formatted text for display.

## Working with Files & Media Properties

### Image URL Property
The **Image URL** property should be set as "Files & media" type in Notion, which allows you to:

- **Upload images directly** to Notion
- **Paste image URLs** from external sources
- **Drag and drop** image files into the property

### Supported Image Sources
- âœ… **Direct uploads** to Notion
- âœ… **External URLs** (from image hosting services)
- âœ… **Notion-hosted images** (automatically handled)
- âœ… **Multiple image formats** (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)

### Best Practices
- Use **high-quality images** (minimum 800px width recommended)
- **Optimize file sizes** for faster loading
- Use **descriptive filenames** for better organization
- Consider using **external CDN** services for better performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Using fallback data" status**
   - Check that your integration token is correct
   - Verify the database ID is accurate
   - Ensure the database is shared with your integration

2. **Empty projects list**
   - Make sure you have projects with "Status" set to "Published"
   - Check that all required properties exist in your database

3. **Type errors**
   - Ensure your Category values match the allowed types
   - Check that Date fields are properly formatted

### Error Messages:

- `Notion database ID is not configured` - Add `VITE_NOTION_DATABASE_ID` to your `.env` file
- `Object does not exist or access denied` - Share your database with the integration
- `Invalid request URL` - Check your database ID format

## Fallback Behavior

If Notion integration fails or is not configured:
- The app will use the static projects from `src/data/projects.ts`
- All functionality remains available
- Users see a status indicator showing fallback mode

## Security Notes

- Keep your integration token secret
- Use environment variables, never commit tokens to git
- The integration only has access to shared databases
- Tokens can be revoked from the Notion integrations page

## Benefits of Notion Integration

- âœ… **Update projects without code changes**
- âœ… **Rich text editing** in Notion's powerful editor
- âœ… **Team collaboration** on project data and content
- âœ… **Version history and backups** automatically maintained
- âœ… **Mobile editing** capability through Notion app
- âœ… **Structured content** with headings, lists, and formatting
- âœ… **Automatic fallback** to static data if Notion is unavailable
- âœ… **Page-based content** allows unlimited detail and formatting
