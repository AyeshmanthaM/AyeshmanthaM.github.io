# Simplified Notion Database Structure

## Required Properties Only

Your Notion database now only needs these properties:

### Required Properties:
- **Title** (Title) - Project name
- **Description** (Text) - Brief project summary  
- **Category** (Select) - Project type (embedded, mechatronics, interactive, automation, iot, other)
- **Technologies** (Multi-select) - Tech stack used
- **Date** (Date) - Project completion date
- **Status** (Select) - Publication status (Published, Draft, Archived)

### Optional Properties:
- **Image URL** (Files & media) - Project thumbnail

## Page Content Structure

Write your detailed project content directly in the Notion page body using headings and formatted text:

```
# Project Overview
Detailed description of the project...

## Technical Implementation  
Architecture, technologies, implementation details...

## Challenges & Solutions
Problems faced and how they were resolved...

## Results & Impact
Achievements, metrics, outcomes...
```
